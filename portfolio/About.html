  <h2>About Me</h2>

  <p>
    Hey, I am <strong>Shaik Sania</strong>, a Computer Science undergraduate (2022–2026), passionate about front-end development, UI/UX design, and creating smooth, interactive web experiences.
  </p>

  <p>
    My journey started with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I’ve expanded into React and MERN stack development. I have <strong>hands-on experience in front-end development through my DocSpot project</strong>, where I worked on building responsive user interfaces, designing registration and login pages, doctor listings, and appointment booking flows. I also integrated front-end components with backend APIs.
  </p>

  <p>
    I enjoy creating clean, user-friendly, and functional interfaces, and I’m always eager to learn and improve my skills through real-world projects.
